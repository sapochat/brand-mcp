## Overview

This MCP serves as a barometer for both brand safety and brand compliance when leveraging LLMs to generate content including text, imagery, or other media. It provides:

- **Brand Safety Evaluation**: Check content against safety categories like profanity, violence, etc.
- **Brand Compliance Checking**: Verify alignment with specific brand guidelines
- **Context-Specific Guidelines**: Apply different rules based on content context (social, documentation, marketing)
- **Detailed Feedback**: Get specific issues and recommendations for improvement

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brand-safety-mcp.git
cd brand-safety-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## Running and Testing

### Starting the MCP Server

To start the Brand MCP server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server uses stdio as the transport mechanism, making it compatible with various MCP clients including Claude Desktop App, Cursor, and other tools that support MCP.

### Testing with Built-in Clients

The package includes several demo clients to test functionality:

#### Basic Test

```bash
npm run test
```

This runs a simple test to verify the MCP server is working correctly.

#### Demo Client

```bash
npm run demo
```

This demonstrates the brand safety and compliance features with example content.

#### SDK Example Client

```bash
npm run sdk-demo
```

This runs a comprehensive example showing how to integrate with the MCP using the SDK, including:
- Brand safety evaluation
- Brand compliance checking
- Context-specific compliance testing

### Integrating with Client Applications

For developers who want to integrate the Brand MCP with their own applications:

```javascript
import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js';
import { StdioClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js';

// Initialize the client
const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: 'node',
  args: ['path/to/dist/index.js'] 
});

const client = new Client({
  name: 'your-client-name',
  version: '1.0.0'
});

// Connect to the server
await client.connect(transport);

// Evaluate content for brand safety
const safetyResult = await client.callTool({
  name: 'evaluateContent',
  arguments: {
    content: "Your content to evaluate"
  }
});

// Check brand compliance
const complianceResult = await client.callTool({
  name: 'checkBrandCompliance',
  arguments: {
    content: "Your content to check",
    context: "social-media" // Optional context
  }
});
```

### Using with Claude

You can use the Brand MCP with Claude in a natural conversational way without requiring JSON formatting. Here's how to set it up and use it in a chat environment:

#### Setup for Claude Desktop App

1. Start your Brand MCP server using `npm start` in a terminal window
2. Open the Claude Desktop App 
3. Configure Claude to use your running MCP server (via Settings > Model Context Protocols)

#### Claude Desktop Configuration

For a more seamless experience, you can configure Claude Desktop to automatically start the Brand MCP server when the app launches:

1. Open the Claude menu on your computer and select "Settings..."
2. Click on "Developer" in the left-hand bar, then click "Edit Config"
3. This will open your configuration file (`claude_desktop_config.json`)
4. Update the file to include the Brand MCP server:

##### Option 1: Direct Path Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brandSafety": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/your/brand-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `"path/to/your/brand-mcp/dist/index.js"` with the absolute path to the compiled index.js file in your brand-mcp project.

For example:
- macOS: `"/Users/username/Documents/brand-mcp/dist/index.js"`
- Windows: `"C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\brand-mcp\\dist\\index.js"`

##### Option 2: Using NPX (If Published to NPM)
If you've published your Brand MCP to NPM, you can use npx for a more streamlined installation:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brandSafety": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@yourusername/brand-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop

When Claude Desktop starts, you should see a hammer icon in the input box, indicating that tools are available. Clicking this icon should show tools including "evaluateContent" and "checkBrandCompliance".

If you don't see the tools, check the logs:
- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp*.log`

##### Troubleshooting Claude Desktop Integration

If the server isn't showing up in Claude Desktop:
1. Make sure you've built the project with `npm run build` before configuring Claude
2. Check that the path in your configuration points to the correct location
3. Try running the server manually to see if there are any errors
4. Check Claude's logs for detailed error information

#### Natural Language Instructions for Claude

Instead of requiring users to provide JSON, you can use natural language prompts:

```
Please check if the following content meets our brand guidelines:

Content: We are excited to announce our new AI product that leverages cutting-edge technology to disrupt the market. This synergistic solution will help you leverage your data assets.

Context: This is for a marketing email
Brand: TechFuture
Focus on: tone and terminology
```

#### Example Response

Claude would analyze this and respond in natural language:

```
I've checked this content against TechFuture's brand guidelines. Here's my analysis:

Compliance Score: 65/100 (Not Compliant)

Issues Found:
1. Terminology: The content uses several terms that should be avoided according to your guidelines:
   - "disrupt" (avoided global term)
   - "synergistic" (avoided global term)
   - "leverage" (appears twice, avoided global term)

2. Tone: The tone relies on business clich√©s rather than the confident, optimistic tone preferred by TechFuture.

Suggestions:
- Replace "disrupt the market" with "transform the market"
- Replace "synergistic solution" with "integrated solution"
- Replace "leverage your data assets" with "utilize your data assets"
- Adjust the overall tone to be more confident and optimistic while avoiding business jargon

Revised Version:
"We're excited to announce our new AI product that uses innovative technology to transform the market. This integrated solution will help you make the most of your data assets."
```

#### Implementation in Conversation Flow

For a seamless conversation experience, you can instruct Claude to:

1. Accept content for review in natural language
2. Apply the appropriate brand guidelines based on context
3. Provide analysis and suggestions in a clear, conversational format
4. Offer revised versions that better align with brand guidelines

This approach makes the Brand MCP accessible to non-technical users who interact with Claude through the desktop app or other chat interfaces.

## Customizing for Your Brand

To customize the MCP for your specific brand, you need to modify the `brandSchema.js` file in the root directory. The schema includes comprehensive dimensions for brand guidelines:

### Brand Identity
```javascript

  tonalShift: {
    // How tone changes across different contexts
    "social-media": "more casual and conversational",
    "documentation": "more detailed and instructive",
    "marketing": "more aspirational and inspiring"
  },
  examples: {
    // Example content demonstrating appropriate tone for different contexts

  }
},
```

### Context-Specific Visual Rules
```javascript
contextualVisualRules: [
  {
    contexts: ["social-media", "blog-informal"], // Contexts where rules apply
    applyRules: {
      imagery: { 
        style: "more vibrant and engaging, potentially using illustrations",
        notes: "Prioritize engagement over strict adherence to primary style"
      },
      typography: { 
        notes: "Can use slightly larger, bolder fonts for emphasis"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    contexts: ["print", "formal-report"],
    applyRules: {
      colors: { 
        notes: "Ensure primary colors are dominant. Use secondary sparingly."
      },
      typography: { 
        headingFont: "Montserrat, sans-serif",
        bodyFont: "Open Sans, sans-serif",
        notes: "Strict adherence to standard font sizes required."
      },
      layout: { 
        preferences: "clean, structured layout with consistent margins",
        notes: "Whitespace is critical for formal print documents."
      }
    }
  }
],
```

### Terminology Guidelines
```javascript
terminologyGuidelines: {
  avoidedGlobalTerms: ["synergy", "leverage", "disruptive"], // Terms to always avoid
  properNouns: {
    productNames: "Always capitalized, no spaces (e.g., ProductName)",
    companyName: "YourCompany (with exact capitalization)"
  },
  terms: [
    {
      preferred: "purchase", // The preferred term to use
      alternatives: ["buy", "acquire"], // Alternative terms to avoid
      contexts: ["ecommerce", "sales"], // Contexts where this rule applies
      notes: "Use 'purchase' in customer-facing transaction contexts."
    },
    {
      preferred: "artificial intelligence",
      alternatives: ["AI"],
      contexts: ["formal", "documentation", "first-mention"],
      notes: "Spell out on first use or in formal documents."
    },
    {
      term: "bleeding edge", // Term to avoid in specific contexts
      avoidInContexts: ["marketing", "formal"],
      notes: "Avoid hype/clich√©. Use 'innovative' or 'advanced' instead."
    }
  ]
},
```

### Context-Specific Adjustments
```javascript
contextualAdjustments: [
  {
    contexts: ["social-media", "blog-informal"], // Contexts where adjustments apply
    applyRules: {
      tone: "more casual and conversational", // Override primary tone
      voice: { 
        usesContractions: true, 
        sentenceLength: "shorter"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    contexts: ["technical-documentation", "api-reference"],
    applyRules: {
      tone: "more detailed and instructive",
      voice: { 
        personality: "precise and helpful expert", 
        usesContractions: false, 
        sentenceStructure: "clear and direct" 
      }
    }
  },
  {
    contexts: ["marketing-landingpage", "marketing-email"],
    applyRules: {
      tone: "more aspirational and inspiring"
    }
  }
]
```

After modifying this file with your brand's specific guidelines, rebuild the project with `npm run build`.

## Moving from Demo to Production

The Brand Safety MCP comes with a demo brand schema (`brandSchema.js`) containing sample guidelines. To implement your own brand safety and compliance rules:

1. First, review the demo implementation by running:
   ```bash
   npm run demo
   ```

2. Next, open the `brandSchema.js` file in the root directory and replace the demo values with your own brand guidelines following the structure outlined above.

3. After customizing your schema, rebuild the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Test your custom implementation:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

> **Note:** All commands (`npm run demo`, `npm run test`, etc.) will use your custom brand schema after you've modified and rebuilt the project.

## Brand Safety Features

The MCP evaluates content across the following safety categories:

- **Sexual Content**: References to sexual themes or explicit material
- **Violence**: Descriptions of physical harm or violent actions
- **Hate Speech**: Language targeting groups based on protected characteristics
- **Harassment**: Content that bullies, intimidates, or threatens
- **Self-Harm**: References to suicide, self-injury, or harmful behaviors
- **Illegal Activities**: Content about crimes, illegal substances, or prohibited actions
- **Profanity**: Inappropriate language, cursing, or vulgar terms
- **Alcohol/Tobacco**: References to alcohol, tobacco, or related products
- **Political Content**: References to political figures, parties, or controversial topics
- **Religious Content**: References to religious beliefs, practices, or institutions

Each category is evaluated on a five-level risk scale: NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, VERY_HIGH.

## Brand Compliance Features

The MCP checks content for compliance with brand guidelines defined in `brandSchema.js`:

### Tone Guidelines
- **Primary Tone**: Checks if content matches the brand's primary tone
- **Avoided Tones**: Ensures content doesn't use tones that should be avoided
- **Contextual Tone**: Applies different tone expectations based on context
- **Enhanced Detection**: Uses multiple detection methods for more accurate results:
  - Keyword analysis with confidence scoring
  - Phrase pattern detection
  - N-gram analysis
  - Section-based analysis for longer content

### Voice Guidelines
- **Contractions**: Checks whether content uses contractions based on brand preferences
- **Pronouns**: Verifies appropriate use of first-person and second-person pronouns
- **Sentence Structure**: Evaluates sentence length and structure patterns

### Terminology Guidelines
- **Prohibited Terms**: Flags globally avoided terms and phrases
- **Preferred Terms**: Identifies when alternatives are used instead of preferred terminology
- **Proper Nouns**: Verifies correct capitalization and formatting of brand names and products
- **Context-Specific Terms**: Applies different terminology rules based on content context
- **Domain Exemptions**: Automatically exempts certain terms in appropriate contexts

## Other Features

### Content Type Detection
The MCP automatically detects the type of content being analyzed and applies appropriate rules:

- **Technical**: Relaxed tone requirements, technical terminology exemptions
- **Marketing**: Appropriate tone for promotional content
- **Legal**: Special handling for legal terminology
- **Educational**: Context-specific rules for educational materials
- **Conversational**: Sentiment-aware analysis

### False Positive Reduction
Multiple mechanisms work together to minimize false positives:

- **Bayesian Probability**: Calculates the likelihood that a detected issue is accurate
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Adjusts sensitivity based on content context
- **Technical Exemptions**: Automatically exempts technical terms in technical contexts
- **Confidence Scoring**: Only flags issues when confidence exceeds thresholds
- **Feedback Learning**: Improves over time based on false positive reports

### Section-Based Analysis
For longer content, the MCP analyzes sections independently:

- **Paragraph Analysis**: Evaluates each paragraph on its own
- **Section Tracking**: Identifies which section contains issues
- **Priority Filtering**: Focuses on the most important issues
- **Length-Aware Scoring**: Adjusts expectations based on content length

### Sentiment Analysis
Basic sentiment detection provides additional context:

- **Positivity**: Measures positive sentiment
- **Negativity**: Measures negative sentiment
- **Objectivity**: Measures factual/neutral language

### Customization Options
Extensive customization options available:

```javascript
// Add custom technical terms to exempt from checks
brandService.addTechnicalTerms([
  'authentication', 'authorization', 'encryption'
]);

// Add custom technical contexts
brandService.addTechnicalContexts([
  'system-requirements', 'architecture-overview'
]);

// Add domain-specific exemptions
brandService.addDomainExemptions('marketing', [
  'promotional', 'limited-time', 'exclusive-offer'
]);

// Report false positives to improve system
brandService.addFalsePositive(issue, originalContent);
```

## Context-Aware Evaluation

The MCP applies different guidelines based on content context, such as:
- **Social Media**: More casual tone, shorter sentences, contractions allowed
- **Technical Documentation**: More detailed tone, precise language, fewer contractions
- **Marketing**: More aspirational tone with specific approved terminology

When checking content, you can specify a context to apply the appropriate guidelines:

```javascript
// Example of calling the checkBrandCompliance tool
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: 'checkBrandCompliance',
  arguments: {
    content: "We're excited to share our latest breakthrough with you!",
    context: "marketing-landingpage" // Optional context
  }
});

// Result includes:
// - complianceScore: Numeric score from 0-100
// - isCompliant: Boolean (typically true if score ‚â• 80)
// - issues: Array of specific compliance issues found
// - summary: Human-readable summary of compliance status
```

1. **Pre-Check Generated Content**: Verify content meets brand guidelines before publishing
2. **Context-Aware Guidelines**: Apply different rules based on where content will appear
3. **Content Correction**: Identify and fix brand compliance issues
4. **Brand Guidelines Access**: Let LLMs retrieve the latest guidelines on demand
5. **Cross-Team Consistency**: Ensure all teams follow the same brand standards

## Example Tool Usage

```javascript
// Safety evaluation
const safetyResult = await client.callTool({
  name: 'evaluateContent',
  arguments: {
    content: "We've designed this feature with your workflow in mind."
  }
});
// Returns safety evaluation across all categories

// Brand compliance check
const complianceResult = await client.callTool({
  name: 'checkBrandCompliance',
  arguments: {
    content: "We've designed this feature with your workflow in mind.",
    context: "documentation"  
  }
});
// Returns detailed brand compliance analysis
```

## Recent Updates

*   **TypeScript Fixes (`src/server/brandService.ts`):** Implemented missing `countTechnicalTerms` and `detectToneWithConfidence` methods to resolve type errors.
*   **Persistent Learning System (`src/server/brandService.ts`):** Introduced a major enhancement allowing the system to learn from false positive feedback (`addFalsePositive`). Learned data (allowlists, thresholds, sensitivity) is stored in `data/learning.json`, and the system adapts compliance checks over time. The `data/` directory has been added to `.gitignore`.
*   **Brand Safety Refinements (`src/server/brandSafetyService.ts`):** Improved evaluation logic for all safety categories by adding word boundary checks (`\b`) to keyword matching and removing ambiguous keywords to minimize false positives.
*   **Codebase Review:** Identified `src/server/simpleServer.ts` as potentially unused code.
