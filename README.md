# Brand Safety MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that performs both brand safety evaluation and brand compliance checking for LLM-generated content. This dual-function approach ensures that content not only avoids harmful categories but also aligns with specific brand voice, tone, terminology, and context-specific guidelines.

## Overview

This MCP serves as a barometer for both brand safety and brand compliance when leveraging LLMs to generate content including text, imagery, or other media. It provides:

- **Brand Safety Evaluation**: Check content against safety categories like profanity, violence, etc.
- **Brand Compliance Checking**: Verify alignment with specific brand guidelines
- **Context-Specific Guidelines**: Apply different rules based on content context (social, documentation, marketing)
- **Detailed Feedback**: Get specific issues and recommendations for improvement

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brand-safety-mcp.git
cd brand-safety-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## Running and Testing

### Starting the MCP Server

To start the Brand MCP server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server uses stdio as the transport mechanism, making it compatible with various MCP clients including Claude Desktop App, Cursor, and other tools that support MCP.

### Testing with Built-in Clients

The package includes several demo clients to test functionality:

#### Basic Test

```bash
npm run test
```

This runs a simple test to verify the MCP server is working correctly.

#### Demo Client

```bash
npm run demo
```

This demonstrates the brand safety and compliance features with example content.

#### SDK Example Client

```bash
npm run sdk-demo
```

This runs a comprehensive example showing how to integrate with the MCP using the SDK, including:
- Brand safety evaluation
- Brand compliance checking
- Context-specific compliance testing

### Integrating with Client Applications

For developers who want to integrate the Brand MCP with their own applications:

```javascript
import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js';
import { StdioClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js';

// Initialize the client
const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: 'node',
  args: ['path/to/dist/index.js'] 
});

const client = new Client({
  name: 'your-client-name',
  version: '1.0.0'
});

// Connect to the server
await client.connect(transport);

// Evaluate content for brand safety
const safetyResult = await client.callTool({
  name: 'evaluateContent',
  arguments: {
    content: "Your content to evaluate"
  }
});

// Check brand compliance
const complianceResult = await client.callTool({
  name: 'checkBrandCompliance',
  arguments: {
    content: "Your content to check",
    context: "social-media" // Optional context
  }
});
```

### Using with Claude

You can use the Brand MCP with Claude in a natural conversational way without requiring JSON formatting. Here's how to set it up and use it in a chat environment:

#### Setup for Claude Desktop App

1. Start your Brand MCP server using `npm start` in a terminal window
2. Open the Claude Desktop App 
3. Configure Claude to use your running MCP server (via Settings > Model Context Protocols)

#### Natural Language Instructions for Claude

Instead of requiring users to provide JSON, you can use natural language prompts:

```
Please check if the following content meets our brand guidelines:

Content: We are excited to announce our new AI product that leverages cutting-edge technology to disrupt the market. This synergistic solution will help you leverage your data assets.

Context: This is for a marketing email
Brand: TechFuture
Focus on: tone and terminology
```

#### Example Response

Claude would analyze this and respond in natural language:

```
I've checked this content against TechFuture's brand guidelines. Here's my analysis:

Compliance Score: 65/100 (Not Compliant)

Issues Found:
1. Terminology: The content uses several terms that should be avoided according to your guidelines:
   - "disrupt" (avoided global term)
   - "synergistic" (avoided global term)
   - "leverage" (appears twice, avoided global term)

2. Tone: The tone relies on business clich√©s rather than the confident, optimistic tone preferred by TechFuture.

Suggestions:
- Replace "disrupt the market" with "transform the market"
- Replace "synergistic solution" with "integrated solution"
- Replace "leverage your data assets" with "utilize your data assets"
- Adjust the overall tone to be more confident and optimistic while avoiding business jargon

Revised Version:
"We're excited to announce our new AI product that uses innovative technology to transform the market. This integrated solution will help you make the most of your data assets."
```

#### Implementation in Conversation Flow

For a seamless conversation experience, you can instruct Claude to:

1. Accept content for review in natural language
2. Apply the appropriate brand guidelines based on context
3. Provide analysis and suggestions in a clear, conversational format
4. Offer revised versions that better align with brand guidelines

This approach makes the Brand MCP accessible to non-technical users who interact with Claude through the desktop app or other chat interfaces.

## Customizing for Your Brand

To customize the MCP for your specific brand, you need to modify the `brandSchema.js` file in the root directory. The schema includes comprehensive dimensions for brand guidelines:

### Brand Identity
```javascript
name: "YourBrandName",
description: "Your brand description",
```

### Tone Guidelines
```javascript
toneGuidelines: {
  primaryTone: "confident", // Main tone of your brand communications
  secondaryTones: ["optimistic", "innovative", "approachable"], // Supporting tones
  avoidedTones: ["pessimistic", "overly technical", "condescending"], // Tones to avoid
  tonalShift: {
    // How tone changes across different contexts
    "social-media": "more casual and conversational",
    "documentation": "more detailed and instructive",
    "marketing": "more aspirational and inspiring"
  },
  examples: {
    // Example content demonstrating appropriate tone for different contexts

  }
},
```

      alternatives: ["buy", "acquire"], // Alternative terms to avoid
      contexts: ["ecommerce", "sales"], // Contexts where this rule applies
      notes: "Use 'purchase' in customer-facing transaction contexts."
    },
    {
      preferred: "artificial intelligence",
      alternatives: ["AI"],

    },
    {
      term: "bleeding edge", // Term to avoid in specific contexts
      avoidInContexts: ["marketing", "formal"],
      notes: "Avoid hype/clich√©. Use 'innovative' or 'advanced' instead."
    }
  ]
},
```

### Context-Specific Adjustments
```javascript
contextualAdjustments: [
  {
    contexts: ["social-media", "blog-informal"], // Contexts where adjustments apply
    applyRules: {

```

After modifying this file with your brand's specific guidelines, rebuild the project with `npm run build`.

## Brand Safety Features

The MCP evaluates content across the following safety categories:

- **Sexual Content**: References to sexual themes or explicit material
- **Violence**: Descriptions of physical harm or violent actions
- **Hate Speech**: Language targeting groups based on protected characteristics
- **Harassment**: Content that bullies, intimidates, or threatens
- **Self-Harm**: References to suicide, self-injury, or harmful behaviors
- **Illegal Activities**: Content about crimes, illegal substances, or prohibited actions
- **Profanity**: Inappropriate language, cursing, or vulgar terms
- **Alcohol/Tobacco**: References to alcohol, tobacco, or related products
- **Political Content**: References to political figures, parties, or controversial topics
- **Religious Content**: References to religious beliefs, practices, or institutions

Each category is evaluated on a five-level risk scale: NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, VERY_HIGH.

## Brand Compliance Features

The MCP checks content for compliance with brand guidelines defined in `brandSchema.js`:

### Tone Guidelines
- **Primary Tone**: Checks if content matches the brand's primary tone
- **Avoided Tones**: Ensures content doesn't use tones that should be avoided
- **Contextual Tone**: Applies different tone expectations based on context

### Voice Guidelines
- **Contractions**: Checks whether content uses contractions based on brand preferences
- **Pronouns**: Verifies appropriate use of first-person and second-person pronouns
- **Sentence Structure**: Evaluates sentence length and structure patterns

### Terminology Guidelines
- **Prohibited Terms**: Flags globally avoided terms and phrases
- **Preferred Terms**: Identifies when alternatives are used instead of preferred terminology
- **Proper Nouns**: Verifies correct capitalization and formatting of brand names and products
- **Context-Specific Terms**: Applies different terminology rules based on content context

## Context-Aware Evaluation

The MCP applies different guidelines based on content context, such as:
- **Social Media**: More casual tone, shorter sentences, contractions allowed
- **Technical Documentation**: More detailed tone, precise language, fewer contractions
- **Marketing**: More aspirational tone with specific approved terminology

When checking content, you can specify a context to apply the appropriate guidelines:

```javascript
// Example of calling the checkBrandCompliance tool
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: 'checkBrandCompliance',
  arguments: {
    content: "We're excited to share our latest breakthrough with you!",
    context: "marketing-landingpage" // Optional context
  }
});

// Result includes:
// - complianceScore: Numeric score from 0-100
// - isCompliant: Boolean (typically true if score ‚â• 80)
// - issues: Array of specific compliance issues found
// - summary: Human-readable summary of compliance status
```
