# Brand Safety MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that performs both brand safety evaluation and brand compliance checking for LLM-generated content. This dual-function approach ensures that content not only avoids harmful categories but also aligns with specific brand voice, tone, terminology, and context-specific guidelines.

## Overview

This MCP serves as a barometer for both brand safety and brand compliance when leveraging LLMs to generate content including text, imagery, or other media. It provides:

- **Brand Safety Evaluation**: Check content against safety categories like profanity, violence, etc.
- **Brand Compliance Checking**: Verify alignment with specific brand guidelines
- **Context-Specific Guidelines**: Apply different rules based on content context (social, documentation, marketing)
- **Detailed Feedback**: Get specific issues and recommendations for improvement

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brand-safety-mcp.git
cd brand-safety-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Starting the MCP Server

```bash
npm start
```

The server uses stdio as the transport mechanism, making it compatible with various MCP clients including Claude Desktop App, Cursor, and other tools that support MCP.

### Integrating with Client Applications

```javascript
import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js';
import { StdioClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js';

// Initialize the client
const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: 'node',
  args: ['path/to/dist/index.js'] 
});

const client = new Client({
  name: 'your-client-name',
  version: '1.0.0'
});

// Connect to the server
await client.connect(transport);

// Evaluate content for brand safety
const safetyResult = await client.callTool({
  name: 'evaluateContent',
  arguments: {
    content: "Your content to evaluate"
  }
});

// Check brand compliance
const complianceResult = await client.callTool({
  name: 'checkBrandCompliance',
  arguments: {
    content: "Your content to check",
    context: "social-media" // Optional context
  }
});
```

## Testing

The package includes several demo clients to test functionality:

### Basic Test

```bash
npm run test
```

This runs a simple test to verify the MCP server is working correctly.

### Demo Client

```bash
npm run demo
```

This demonstrates the brand safety and compliance features with example content.

### SDK Example Client

```bash
npm run sdk-demo
```

This runs a comprehensive example showing how to integrate with the MCP using the SDK, including:
- Brand safety evaluation
- Brand compliance checking
- Context-specific compliance testing

## Customizing for Your Brand

To customize the MCP for your specific brand, you need to modify the `brandSchema.js` file in the root directory. The schema includes comprehensive dimensions for brand guidelines:

### Brand Identity
```javascript
name: "YourBrandName",
description: "Your brand description",
```

### Tone Guidelines
```javascript
toneGuidelines: {
  primaryTone: "confident", // Main tone of your brand communications
  secondaryTones: ["optimistic", "innovative", "approachable"], // Supporting tones
  avoidedTones: ["pessimistic", "overly technical", "condescending"], // Tones to avoid
  tonalShift: {
    // How tone changes across different contexts
    "social-media": "more casual and conversational",
    "documentation": "more detailed and instructive",
    "marketing": "more aspirational and inspiring"
  },
  examples: {
    // Example content demonstrating appropriate tone for different contexts
    "social": "Example of social media post tone",
    "documentation": "Example of documentation tone",
    "marketing": "Example of marketing content tone"
  }
},
```

### Voice Guidelines
```javascript
voiceGuidelines: {
  personality: "knowledgeable but accessible; a helpful expert", // Brand personality
  sentence: {
    length: "varied, but generally concise", // Preferred sentence length
    structure: "clear and direct, with simple language" // Preferred structure
  },
  usesContractions: true, // Whether to use contractions (e.g., "we're" vs "we are")
  usesPronoun: {
    firstPerson: true, // Use "we", "our", etc.
    secondPerson: true // Use "you", "your", etc.
  },
  examples: {
    // Examples demonstrating the brand voice
    "typical": "We've designed this feature with your workflow in mind."
  }
},
```

### Visual Identity
```javascript
visualIdentity: {
  colors: {
    primary: ["#0063B2", "#9CC3D5"], // Primary brand colors (hex codes)
    secondary: ["#F9A826", "#D8E9A8"], // Secondary brand colors
    forbidden: ["#FF0000", "#FF00FF"] // Colors that should never be used
  },
  typography: {
    headingFont: "Montserrat, sans-serif", // Font family for headings
    bodyFont: "Open Sans, sans-serif", // Font family for body text
    fontSizes: {
      // Recommended font sizes
      heading: {
        h1: "2.5rem",

```javascript
contextualVisualRules: [
  {
    contexts: ["social-media", "blog-informal"], // Contexts where rules apply
    applyRules: {
      imagery: { 
        style: "more vibrant and engaging, potentially using illustrations",
        notes: "Prioritize engagement over strict adherence to primary style"
      },

    }
  ]
},
```

### Context-Specific Adjustments
```javascript
contextualAdjustments: [
  {
    contexts: ["social-media", "blog-informal"], // Contexts where adjustments apply
    applyRules: {

```

After modifying this file with your brand's specific guidelines, rebuild the project with `npm run build`.

## Brand Safety Features

The MCP evaluates content across the following safety categories:

- **Sexual Content**: References to sexual themes or explicit material
- **Violence**: Descriptions of physical harm or violent actions
- **Hate Speech**: Language targeting groups based on protected characteristics
- **Harassment**: Content that bullies, intimidates, or threatens
- **Self-Harm**: References to suicide, self-injury, or harmful behaviors
- **Illegal Activities**: Content about crimes, illegal substances, or prohibited actions
- **Profanity**: Inappropriate language, cursing, or vulgar terms
- **Alcohol/Tobacco**: References to alcohol, tobacco, or related products
- **Political Content**: References to political figures, parties, or controversial topics
- **Religious Content**: References to religious beliefs, practices, or institutions

Each category is evaluated on a five-level risk scale: NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, VERY_HIGH.

## Brand Compliance Features

The MCP checks content for compliance with brand guidelines defined in `brandSchema.js`:

### Tone Guidelines
- **Primary Tone**: Checks if content matches the brand's primary tone
- **Avoided Tones**: Ensures content doesn't use tones that should be avoided
- **Contextual Tone**: Applies different tone expectations based on context

### Voice Guidelines
- **Contractions**: Checks whether content uses contractions based on brand preferences
- **Pronouns**: Verifies appropriate use of first-person and second-person pronouns
- **Sentence Structure**: Evaluates sentence length and structure patterns

### Terminology Guidelines
- **Prohibited Terms**: Flags globally avoided terms and phrases
- **Preferred Terms**: Identifies when alternatives are used instead of preferred terminology
- **Proper Nouns**: Verifies correct capitalization and formatting of brand names and products
- **Context-Specific Terms**: Applies different terminology rules based on content context

## Context-Aware Evaluation

The MCP applies different guidelines based on content context, such as:
- **Social Media**: More casual tone, shorter sentences, contractions allowed
- **Technical Documentation**: More detailed tone, precise language, fewer contractions
- **Marketing**: More aspirational tone with specific approved terminology

When checking content, you can specify a context to apply the appropriate guidelines:

```javascript
// Example of calling the checkBrandCompliance tool
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: 'checkBrandCompliance',
  arguments: {
    content: "We're excited to share our latest breakthrough with you!",
    context: "marketing-landingpage" // Optional context
  }
});

// Result includes:
// - complianceScore: Numeric score from 0-100
// - isCompliant: Boolean (typically true if score ‚â• 80)
// - issues: Array of specific compliance issues found
// - summary: Human-readable summary of compliance status
```

## Using with Claude

You can use this Brand MCP with Claude by providing simple instructions and example JSON format. Claude can then use this format to check content against your brand guidelines.

### Instructions for Claude

Here's a template you can use with Claude:

```
I need you to check if the following content meets our brand guidelines. Use this JSON format for your analysis:

{
  "content": "The content to evaluate",
  "context": "marketing", // Optional: can be "social-media", "documentation", "marketing", etc.
  "brandName": "YourBrandName",
  "primaryChecks": ["tone", "voice", "terminology"] // Optional: specify which aspects to focus on
}

Please return the analysis with a compliance score, any issues found, and suggestions for improvement.
```

### Example Request

```json
{
  "content": "We are excited to announce our new AI product that leverages cutting-edge technology to disrupt the market. This synergistic solution will help you leverage your data assets.",
  "context": "marketing-email",
  "brandName": "TechFuture",
  "primaryChecks": ["tone", "terminology"]
}
```

### Example Response

Claude would analyze this using the Brand MCP and return:

```json
{
  "complianceScore": 65,
  "isCompliant": false,
  "issues": [
    {
      "type": "terminology",
      "issue": "Use of avoided terms: 'disrupt', 'synergistic', 'leverage'",
      "suggestion": "Replace with preferred terminology: Consider 'transform the market' instead of 'disrupt', 'integrated' instead of 'synergistic', and 'utilize' instead of 'leverage'"
    },
    {
      "type": "tone",
      "issue": "Tone is too formal and uses clich√©d business language",
      "suggestion": "Adjust to a more confident and optimistic tone that avoids business clich√©s"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "The content does not meet TechFuture's brand guidelines. It uses several avoided terms ('disrupt', 'synergistic', 'leverage') and has a tone that relies on business clich√©s rather than the confident, optimistic tone preferred by the brand."
}
```

### Implementation Notes

To use Claude with your Brand MCP:

1. Start your Brand MCP server using `npm start`
2. In your Claude prompt, include instructions to analyze content using the JSON format shown above
3. You can customize the context field to match your specific use cases (e.g., "social-media", "documentation")
4. For more advanced use cases, you can create a custom client that allows Claude to directly call your Brand MCP server
